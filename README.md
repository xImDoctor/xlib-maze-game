# Multiplayer Maze Game 
> The client-server maze game in course of System Coding with Xlib, pthreads and sockets

The game is a multi-player maze with a client-server architecture, where players must reach the exit, avoiding the enemy who changes the structure of the maze.

## About current state of the project
The game core (the server part mainly) is almost fully completed. However most of the messages to the client part are currently not visualized in the `XWindow` and are displayed in the console where your client is run.

I plan to finalize the project in the near future to a specific *"combat"* version, but I can't say when exactly.

Now it is a kind of exam project implemented overnight ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‚ as part of the **System Programming** studing course somewhat covering work with an Internet connection (`TCP/IPv4`, `sockets`) and multithreading with `POSIX threads`.

## Current Game Features

- **Procedural maze generation** with guaranteed passability
- **Up to 9 players** at the same time (indicated by numbers 0-8)
- **A smart enemy** that changes the walls of the maze when moving
- **Multithreaded architecture** using pthread
- **Graphical interface** based on X11/Xlib
- **Network communication** via TCP sockets


### Dependencies
- Linux with X11
- GCC compiler
- Xlib11-dev
- Make (to build)


#### Installation of dependencies

**Ubuntu/Debian:**
```bash
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev build-essential
```


## Build with `make`

```bash
# full project (client+server)
make all

# separately
make server
make client

# with debug info
make debug-server
make debug-client
```


## Game start (run instruction)

### 1. Run server
```bash
./game-server
```
The server will start on **port 8080** and start accepting connections

> Warning: make sure that **port 8080** is free or set your own value for the `SERVER_PORT` macro in the *maze-game/game_commons.h* file.


### 2. Run clients
```bash
# Connect to local server
./game-client 127.0.0.1

# Connect to remote one
./game-client <ip-address-of-server>
```

### Clean
To remove buit files:
```bash
make clean
```


## Controls

- **WASD** or **arrows** - move player
- **ESC** - close the game


## Game Rules

### Goal
Get to the green cage (exit) before the other players and avoid getting caught by the enemy.


### Game Field Elements
- **Black cells** - walls (impassable)
- **White cells** - passageways
- **Green cage** - exit from the maze
- **Blue circles with numbers** - players (0-8, in current realization)
- **Red circle** - enemy


### Enemy Mechanics
- The enemy is moving in a random direction every second
- Upon exiting the cell, the enemy **inverts** its state:
- If there was a wall -> becomes a passage
- If there was a passage -> becomes a wall
- When colliding with a player -> the player loses

If the player gets caught by the enemy, he loses and loses control, but he can anyway follow the match.


## Architecture

### Server
- **Main thread** - accepts client connections
- **Enemy thread** - controls enemy movement (every second or with your delay at *maze-game/game_commons.h* if you host server)
- **Client threads** - process messages from each player
- **Mutexes** - protect the game state from racing threads

### Client
- **Main thread** - X11 event processing (keyboard, rendering)
- **Network thread** - receiving updates from the server
- **Mutexes** - synchronization of the playing field between threads

### Communication protocol
Messages between client and server:
- `MSG_CONNECT` - connecting a new player
- `MSG_MOVE` - player movement
- `MSG_GAME_STATE` - the state of the playing field
- `MSG_PLAYER_LOST` - notification of defeat
- `MSG_DISCONNECT` - disabling the player


## Debug
The project organizes the output of messages to the console.

### Server
- Information about player connections/disconnections
- Notifications of defeats and victories

### Client
- Server connection status
- Assigned to player ID
- Defeat notifications


## Extenstions
I'll think about it later... Firstly I wanna upgrade player's UI
